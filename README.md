## 📝 Description

**AD-Manager** is a PowerShell script aimed at simplifying Active Directory tasks on Windows systems. This application can detect whether it's running on a Windows client or server and adapts accordingly, enabling various AD management actions from a single interface. 

Despite its rough coding, **AD-Manager** provides essential AD functions, making it a straightforward choice for managing domain tasks directly from one app.

## ✨ Features

- **Rename Computer**: Change the computer name in the AD environment.
- **User Management**: Create new user accounts.
- **Group Management**: Create and manage user groups.
- **Organizational Units (OU)**: Create OUs to organize AD resources.
- **IP Configuration**: Update IP address settings directly from the app.
- **Domain Join**: Join the computer to an AD domain with ease.

## ▶️ Usage

1. Launch the PowerShell script, which will open the AD-Manager application.
2. Choose the desired AD operation from the interface (rename computer, create user, etc.).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the selected action.

## 📦 Dependencies

- **Windows PowerShell** (Version 5.1 or higher recommended)
- **Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell** (only for some AD-related features)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is an older project, and some parts of the code may be inefficient or outdated. While the app is fully functional, it’s not a final polished product and might lack some optimization or modern best practices.
